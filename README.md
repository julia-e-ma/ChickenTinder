Android App to help choose a restaurant

Teaching myself Kotlin and Jetpack Compose to create an app that will check your location and allow two people to swipe yes or no on restaurants they'd like to eat at. The users will be shown the restaurants they "match" on and this will help them choose  a spot for dinner. 

Future features will include:
- location permissions
- user profiles
- restaurant swiping
- distance measurements of each restaurant
- hours/availability of restaurants
- previous reviews of restaurants 


App preview as of 1/24/24: <br>
The app can request to use location services and prints your current location upon hitting the button.<br><br>
Next feature: Integrating Google Maps API to display your location on the map instead of showing Lat/Long<br>
